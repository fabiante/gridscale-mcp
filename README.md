# Gridscale MCP

This is a [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture) which allows AI modells
to interact with the [Gridscale API](https://my.gridscale.io/product-documentation/cloud-computing/apis/public-api/introduction/)

You can use this with tools such as [5ire](https://5ire.app/) to let your LLM provision infrastructre as you wish.

**Danger:** It should be obvious that letting an AI model interact with your infrastructure could cause you harm.
Just imagine what would happen if an AI model deleted your production database?
Do not use this for production purposes.
